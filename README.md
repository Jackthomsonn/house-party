# House Party
### Because I'm a party animal

Have you ever been to a restaurant & been able to choose your own music to play? Well, this is where I got my inspiration from, & I wanted to create something similiar that could work at home, aka, House Parties. No more fighting who chooses the music, NOW EVERYONE CAN! I'm planning on using this at home when I get the courage to throw a house party in my pad (I just like eveything to be in order, house parties ruin that order), & maybe use it in work for Friday discos, who knows, it could be the next big thing ;)
